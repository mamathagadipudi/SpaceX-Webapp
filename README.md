# SpaceX-Webapp

Once you have imported the project into your IDE, please run the following gradle tasks:

Gradle Build
Gradle bootRun

I configured the application to run on port 8081 and this can be updated in Application.properties.

API can be accessed using the below URLs:

Rockets: http://localhost:8081/rockets  
Launches: http://localhost:8081/launches?id=1   (ID can be updated to get a specific launch information, available launch IDs are 1-100)
